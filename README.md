Test demo for Ignite Solutions

This application is a demo application for showing all the questions working answer. 
Here I have used many concept such as Singleton which was asked in first question. 
Then second question which was in reference to Product Flavor.
Then third question which was in reference to Fragments.
Then the fourth question which was in reference to Alert Dialog.
Then the Fifth question which was in reference to Services.

Firstly i created a Main Screen which contains 5 buttons referring to all the questions

![mainActivity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918828/93720571-8a805d80-fba7-11ea-9eab-f36f2b8a301a.jpeg)

In the first question i created one singleton class and a counter class to make a counter using singleton class.

![singletonCounter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918828/93720878-a258e100-fba9-11ea-9a25-dc13ed724fea.jpeg)

![singletonCounter1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918828/93720880-a2f17780-fba9-11ea-95fd-6603fb409c73.jpeg)

In this as we can see that we have a textview and a floating button, as we click on floating button or counter increase and shows in textview.

The Second question is regarding product flavor as we can see there is a textview at the last of the main activity which is telling if the activity is fee version 
or paid version, which reffers to different flavors using the same base code.

![mainActivity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918828/93720874-a127b400-fba9-11ea-9a7b-7426a57f33b2.jpeg)

The third question is regarding fragments where we can see different fragments in a single activity.

![fragmentSequence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918828/93720873-9ff68700-fba9-11ea-8bc1-3016bc8ff28f.jpeg)

As we can see that there is also a textview which is showing the sequence of the fragments as it populate in the activity.

The fourth question is regarding Alert Dialog and real time print which includes textview, editview and button.

![alertDialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918828/93720870-9d942d00-fba9-11ea-8424-1a06fac8be52.jpeg)

In this alertDialog there is a textview which is using typeface and is showing data in real time.

![clickOnButton](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918828/93720872-9ec55a00-fba9-11ea-95ed-6f699491faa8.jpeg)

On button click of submit their is a toast message showing that button click feature is also working.

The fifth question is regarding Services where we have to show if UI can be affected by services.

![service](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918828/93720876-a1c04a80-fba9-11ea-9a30-aed40f60c7ec.jpeg)

![servicesTime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40918828/93720877-a258e100-fba9-11ea-876d-bc6bf2763037.jpeg)

In service question i used a bound activity and bound service which is used to make changes in UI of the class.
I have created a button and textview in an activity which shows the duration of the service been active after the button click in the main activity,
this has been achived through timestamp.
